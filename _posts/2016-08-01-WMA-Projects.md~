If you decide to keep working on your mini-project and plan to extend your analysis for your end-of-camp project that is totally fine! But, if you wanted to explore a different topic or dataset that is also fine. Just make sure that you have enough time to finish the project and presentation by Friday. For those of you looking to explore something different than your mini-project here are some projects that we have put together. Most have a series of exercises to get you comfortable with the data and the type of analysis you'll do. Then, you will explore an original question your team comes up with after doing these exercises. If you just want to use the data from one of these projects to answer your own question that is also fine!

- [EPL Payroll Project](../../../assets/moneyball/EPL_payroll_project.zip)
- [Football Simulation Project](../../../assets/moneyball/football_project.zip)
- [MLB Salary Project](../../../assets/moneyball/MLB_salary_project.zip)
- [NBA Shot Distance Project](../../../assets/moneyball/NBA_shot_distance_project.zip)
- [Pythagorean Prediction Project](../../../assets/moneyball/pythagorean_project.zip)

** NOTE: These projects are a bit more involved than what you've seen thus far so make sure you think you can make enough progress on them by Friday to give a solid presentation **
