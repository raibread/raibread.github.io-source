I'll be using this site to post notes and other expository material for STAT 102. You can find these resources under the [Teaching](/Teaching/) tab. The most important of these resources will be the _Course Guide_, which I will update throughout the semester. In this document you'll be able to find important formulas and concepts that we will cover.
