Today we will talk about lists in R and how we use them with functions that return more than one output, the `lm()` function to do linear regression, and the `aggregate()` function. Go ahead and download the [MLB payroll dataset](../../../assets/moneyball/mlb_team_payroll.csv) to your working directory and load it with a heading and Strings as factors unchecked. You'll also want to download [this R script template](../../../assets/moneyball/regression_lecture.R) which you'll use to follow along while we work through the code together.
