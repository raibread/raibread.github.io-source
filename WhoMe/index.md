My name is Raiden Hasegawa and this is my website... Welcome! I am a PhD statistician who graduated in 2019 from the Statistics department at the Wharton School - University of Pennsylvania. I am currently a data scientist at Google. My current and past research interests include causal inference in the social and biomedical sciences and Bayesian economic forecasting. Prior to becoming a doctoral student I was a research associate at the New York Federal Reserve Bank, an environmental consultant, and a quantitative electricity trader. When I am not thinking about stats I am rock climbing, windsurfing, and exploring Philadelphia with my wife (Susanna) and pup (Poppy).
