My name is Raiden Hasegawa and this is my website... Welcome! I am a fourth year PhD student at the Wharton School - University of Pennsylvania. My current and past research interests include causal inference in the social and biomedical sciences and Bayesian economic forecasting. Prior to becoming a doctoral student I was a research associate at the New York Federal Reserve Bank, an environmental consultant, and a quantitative electricity trader. When I am not thinking about stats I am rock climbing, windsurfing, and exploring Philadelphia with my wife (Susanna) and pup (Poppy).
