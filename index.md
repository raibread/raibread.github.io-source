My name is Raiden Hasegawa and I am a fifth year PhD student in the Statistics Department at [The Wharton School - University of Pennsylvania](https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/). My advisor is [Dylan S. Small](http://www-stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~dsmall/). I am currently on the job market for 2019 \[[CV](../assets/CV/Hasegawa_CV.pdf)\].

### Research Interests
Broadly, my research focuses on developing new methods in causal inference for application to the social, economic, and biomedical sciences.  Recent work includes developing novel study designs to mitigate plausible sources of bias and extending sensitivity analysis -- a method for assessing the robustness of study findings to unmeasured confounding -- to handle heterogeneous and potentially unbounded sources of bias.

### More About Me
Prior to becoming a doctoral student I was a research associate at the New York Federal Reserve Bank working on several Bayesian economic forecasting projects, an environmental consultant, and a quantitative electricity trader. When I am not thinking about stats I am rock climbing, biking, and exploring Baltimore where I live with my wife and pup.
