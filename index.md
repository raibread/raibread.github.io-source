My name is Raiden Hasegawa and I am a PhD statistician who graduated from the Statistics Department at [The Wharton School - University of Pennsylvania](https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/) in 2019. My advisor was [Dylan S. Small](http://www-stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~dsmall/). I am currently a data scientist at [Google](http://www.google.com) \[[CV](../assets/CV/Hasegawa_CV.pdf)\].

### Research Interests
Broadly, my research focuses on developing new methods in causal inference for application to the social, economic, and biomedical sciences.  Recent works includes developing a factorial vaccine trial design that leverages Mendelian randomization to estimate malaria vaccine efficacy when there is no gold standard case definition; developing novel observational study designs to mitigate plausible sources of bias; and extending sensitivity analysis -- a method for assessing the robustness of study findings to unmeasured confounding -- to handle heterogeneous and potentially unbounded sources of bias.

### More About Me
Prior to becoming a doctoral student I was a research associate at the New York Federal Reserve Bank working on several Bayesian economic forecasting projects, an environmental consultant, and a quantitative electricity trader. When I am not thinking about stats I am rock climbing, biking, and exploring Baltimore where I live with my wife and pup.
